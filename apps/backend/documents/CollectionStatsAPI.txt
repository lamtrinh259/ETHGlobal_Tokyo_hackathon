The CollectionStats API offers aggregated data for NFT collections (ERC721 and ERC1155) at the collection level.
Timeframe filter details (all times are in UTC) for when the sale transactions are captured for the aggregation:
Daily - starts from 00:00 am to 11:59 pm every day
Weekly - starts from 00:00 am on Monday to 11:59 pm on the same week Sunday
Monthly - 00:00 am on the first calendar day of the month to 11:59 pm on the last calendar day of the month. If querying the current month, the aggregation would be from the first calendar day to the most recent daily aggregation.
Yearly - 00:00 am on the first day of the year to 11:59 pm on the last day of the year. If querying the current year, the aggregation would be from the first calendar day to the most recent daily aggregation.
Lifetime - from the first recorded sale of the NFT inside a collection to the most recent daily aggregation.
