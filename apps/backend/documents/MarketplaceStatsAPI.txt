The MarketplaceStats API retrieves aggregated information for a particular NFT marketplace.
Timeframe filter details (all times are in UTC) for when the sale transactions are captured for the aggregation:
Daily - starts from 00:00 am to 11:59 pm every day
Weekly - starts from 00:00 am on Monday to 11:59 pm on the same week Sunday
Monthly - 00:00 am on the first calendar day of the month to 11:59 pm on the last calendar day of the month. If querying the current month, the aggregation would be from the first calendar day to the most recent daily aggregation.
Yearly - 00:00 am on the first day of the year to 11:59 pm on the last day of the year. If querying the current year, the aggregation would be from the first calendar day to the most recent daily aggregation.
Lifetime - from the first recorded sale to the most recent daily aggregation.
