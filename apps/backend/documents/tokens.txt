The Tokens API retrieves high-level information on ERC20 tokens, ERC721 tokens (also known as NFT contracts, "Collections," or "NFT Collections," containing multiple tokens), and ERC1155 tokens (also called NFT contracts, "Collections," or "NFT Collections," containing several tokens).

These are the available filters for the Tokens API:

input TokenFilter {
  address: # Token contract address on the blockchain (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155)
  name:  # Name of the contract (e.g. "Moonbirds"). Note that this will fetch all contracts with the name "Moonbirds"
  symbol: # Symbol of the contract (e.g. "BAYC"). Note - it will return all contracts that have the same symbol.
  type: # ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155
}

This is the schema for the Tokens API:

type Token {
  address: Address! # Token contract address on the blockchain
  baseURI: String # Returns the base URI
  blockchain: Blockchain # Blockchain where the token is deployed
  chainId: String # Airstack unique identifier for the blockchain
  contractMetaData: ContractMetadata # Token's contract metadata object
  contractMetaDataURI: String # URI for the token's contract metadata
  currentHolderCount: Int # Number of current token holders
  decimals: Int # Number of decimal places for the token's smallest unit
  id: ID # Airstack unique identifier for the contract
  lastTransferBlock: Int # Block number of the token's most recent transfer
  lastTransferHash: String # Hash of the token's most recent transfer
  lastTransferTimestamp: Time # Timestamp of the token's most recent transfer
  logo: # Logo image for the contract in various sizes (if available)
  name: String # Token contract name
  rawContractMetaData: # Token contract metadata as it appears inside the contact
  symbol: String # Token contract symbol (ticker)
  tokenBalances: # **Nested query** - allows querying Token Balance information
  tokenNfts: # **Nested query** - individual NFT token data
  tokenTraits: Map # Returns count of all token attribute types and values
  totalSupply: String # Total supply of the token
  type: Tokentype # ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155
}
```
