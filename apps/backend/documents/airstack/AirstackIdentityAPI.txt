Airstack Identity API has been integrated throughout all of the GraphQL queries! You can filter your queries using the identity inputs by passing the following values instead of a blockchain address:
ENS input - uses resolved address to get the data.
You can enter ENS address directly in the “address” field, for example:
vitalik.eth
ens:vitalik.eth - “ens:” prefix is optional
Farcaster input.
You can enter Farcaster inputs in the “address” field as follows:
fc_fid:5650 - use “fc_fid:” prefix followed by the Farcaster user ID
fc_fname:vbuterin - use “fc_fname:” prefix followed by the Farcaster user ID
Alternatively, you can enter the Farcaster profile name directly in the Socials profileName field.

Example: ID1 Show me all NFTs and their images currently being held by Farcaster user: dwr
query ID1 {
  TokenBalances(input: {filter: {owner: {_eq: "fc_fname:dwr"}, tokenType: {_in: [ERC721, ERC1155]}}, blockchain: ethereum}) {
    TokenBalance {
      tokenNfts {
        address
        tokenId
        contentValue {
          image {
            medium
          }
        }
        token {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
