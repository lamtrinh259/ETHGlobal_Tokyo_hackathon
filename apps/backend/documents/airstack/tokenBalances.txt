The TokenBalances API covers the owners and balances of ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens.

These are the available filters for the TokenBalances API:

input TokenBalanceFilter {
  owner: # Identity: blockchain address, domain name, social identity
  tokenAddress: # Token contract address on the blockchain (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155)
  tokenId: # Unique NFT token ID
  tokenType: # ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155
}

This is the schema for the TokenBalances API:
