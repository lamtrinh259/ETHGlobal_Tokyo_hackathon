About Airstack
Web3 data APIs for developers
Instantly integrate on-chain and off-chain data into any application.
Airstack is a web3 developer platform that provides powerful APIs for integrating on-chain and off-chain data into any application. With Airstack developers are able to easily connect their applications to the web3 ecosystem.
Airstack enables GraphQL queries that combine on-chain and off-chain data from multiple sources in a single response. Our goal is to enable developers to query and integrate relevant web3 data and serve it up to users without requiring heavy infrastructure or even a back-end.
Airstack identity APIs map addresses and transactions across various sources, including ENS, Farcaster, Lens, POAP, Dapps, and Marketplaces.
