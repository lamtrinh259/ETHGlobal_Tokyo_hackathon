API Reference
Airstack uniquely enables complex queries/responses across multiple on-chain and off-chain data sources.

Here are some high level pointers:

The Airstack Identity API has been integrated throughout all of the GraphQL queries! You can filter your queries using identity fields such as address, ENS, Farcaster, and more.
​
Nested Queries enable you to query across the entire data set from any of the APIs. This allows you to write complex simultaneous queries/responses all-at-once vs. having to daisy-chain multiple queries.
​
​Logical comparators & complex queries
​
In GraphQL, logical comparators like _and , _nor, and _or are used to combine multiple filtering conditions, allowing you to create more complex queries.
