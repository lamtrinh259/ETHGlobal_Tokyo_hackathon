The Wallet APIs deliver comprehensive data about a specific wallet address, including the tokens they currently possess, the domain names they own, their token transfer and sale history, and their on-chain social profiles (like ENS, Farcaster).

From the Wallet API it’s possible to create complex queries using nested queries, such as: Get the primary ENS, the Farcaster user name, the Farcaster connected Addresses, all tokens held by the wallet, all NFT Sales by the wallet, all token transfers.

These are the available filters for the Wallet API:

input WalletInput {
  identity: # Identity: blockchain address, domain name, social identity
}

This is the schema for the Wallet API:

type Wallet {
  addresses: Addresses! # returns addresses associated with the identity input
  domains: # Nested query - allows querying domains owned by the address
  identity: # return identity passed from the input
  nftSaleTransactions: # Nested query - allows querying NFT Sales by the address
  primaryDomain: # Nested query - allows returning primary domains, if applicable
  socials: # returns social profile information related to the address
  tokenBalances: # Nested query - allows returning token balances
  tokenTransfers: # Nested query - allows returning token transfers and related information

}
